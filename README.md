Tableau SQL Projects 📊

Overview
This repository showcases my journey in learning SQL with a focus on data analysis using Tableau. The projects explore the Northwind and Sakila databases, diving into food import/export data and enhancing SQL skills through various queries and joins.

Project Breakdown

Day 2: SQL with Northwind Database 🍴
Dataset: Food import/export data (Northwind DB)

Skills Practiced:
Schema design 📐

Basic SQL Queries:
SELECT, FROM, DISTINCT, COUNT, WHERE, AND, OR, NOT, ORDER BY, DESC, LIMIT, MIN, MAX, AVG, SUM, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, and Aliases.

Goal: Explore and manipulate the dataset to understand food trade patterns.

Day 3: SQL Joins & Grouping 🔗

Skills Practiced:
Schema design 📐

SQL Joins:
INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN, CROSS JOIN.

GROUP BY: Aggregating data based on specific columns.

Goal: Gain deeper insights by connecting tables and organizing data for analysis.

Exercises: Sakila Database 🎬

Practiced SQL queries with the Sakila DB, further solidifying concepts and refining skills through hands-on exercises.

Key Skills Developed 🧠

SQL Basics: Mastered fundamental SQL functions and operators for data exploration.

Joins: Built complex queries to combine and analyze data from multiple tables.
